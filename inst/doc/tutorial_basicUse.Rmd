rSubmmiter is a package that allows simple communication between R and a SLURM cluster to achieve three main tasks:

1. Easy submission, monitoring and management of individual cluster jobs.
2. Easy and fast submission of many cluster jobs, by implementing SLURM arrays.
3. Seamlessly parallelization of lapply.
